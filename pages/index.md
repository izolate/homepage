# izolate ⚡

My name is Yosh (or यशोधन) and I'm an indie hacker. As a full stack engineer, I draw upon my interests in art, design and anthropology to bring a unique perspective to the trade.

I'm currently in Osaka, Japan 🇯🇵, persuing a life of a digital nomad. Aside from code, I enjoy taking photographs, seeking new food adventures, traveling, and playing music.

Please [contact me](/contact) if you're looking to work together.
